# API-Homework
API homework puts all the skills I have learned until now, focusing on using APIs as part of the technical solution - to create two financial analysis tools.

- The first tool is a personal finance planner that allow users to visualize their savings in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund.

- The second tool is a retirement planning tool that uses the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of 60% stocks (SPY) and 40% bonds(AGG), then runs Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years to calculate the expected portfolio returns given an initial investment amount of $20,000.
